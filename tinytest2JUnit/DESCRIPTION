Description: Unit testing is a solid component of automated CI/CD pipelines. As alternative to 'testthat' a light-weight,
	zero-dependency package, called 'tinytest', was developed. To be able to integrate the 'tinytest' results into common CI/CD
	systems the 'tinytest'-object needs to be converted to JUnit XML, which is the purpose of 'tinytest2JUnit',
	while keeping the zero-dependency nature.
Suggests: 
	tinytest
